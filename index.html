              I love interacting with different people and have a patient to
              listen to them. And my weakness is that I go by the rules a lot.

              with perfection rather than meeting the deadline. I am highly
              skilled in DCA( Diploma in Computer Application )

              accomplished extensive experience in web Designing Familiar with

              money to prosecute my further studies then I started working on
              online and earned money by making website And the second thing is
              that when I was in international call centre and gave my best
              performance to achieve the targets which was given by the company
              and i was appointed as a Back office Assistant. And the 3rd and
              4th when I got 93% in 12th class i have been awarded with Gold
              Medel and the last one is that when I was dealing with the people
              over the phone in Airtel post paid(customer service executive) and
